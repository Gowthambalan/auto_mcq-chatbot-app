# auto_mcq-chatbot-app

This project is an interactive chatbot-based learning tool designed to assist students with subject-wise conceptual understanding and dynamic quiz generation. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector databases to extract knowledge from subject-specific PDF files and generate contextually relevant multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
